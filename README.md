- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m @markrypt0. I am a firmware developer and have extensive experience in security architecture. I am a former Shapeshift dev who has had the longest professional experience developing KeepKey hardware wallet firmware, up to the point when Shapeshift and KeepKey moved into the DAO universe.
